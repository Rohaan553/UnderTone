## About

UnderTone is a mobile app that takes an English text input and uses machine learning-powered sentiment analysis to identify the emotion(s) expressed by that text, with the goal of helping non-native speakers of English understand how their text messages might come across to others.

We trained a VertexAI model on the GoEmotions dataset (https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/goemotions) with "[NAME]" placeholders substituted with actual names. The code for the performed data manipulation can be found here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1n9OumaIcEfVLhrD09wgmTAnHQFsH2Tno#scrollTo=xXoQhWOtCRwk

## How to Contribute

**PREREQUISITES:**  Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) 17+ and the `npm` package manager installed on your computer. Register an Expo account at https://expo.dev/signup, install the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app on your mobile device or simulator, and log in to your Expo account within the app. Both your computer and your mobile environment should be connected to the same network.

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Rohaan553/UnderTone.git` to download the app files to your computer.
2. `cd` into the `src` directory and run `npm install` to install the app's dependencies.
3. Run `npx expo login` and enter your Expo account credentials to log in to Expo Application Services on your computer.
4. Run `npx expo start` to start the development server.
5. On your mobile device, the development server should automatically appear on the **Home** tab of Expo Go.

**.env Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the `src` directory with the following parameters, one per line:

1. `API_TOKEN="your_token_here"` - To get the token run `gcloud auth print-access-token` from the Google Cloud Shell
2. `ENDPOINT_ID="endpoint_id_here"` - Can be found on the Deploy & Test page of the model on Vertex AI under 'Sample request'
3. `PROJECT_ID="project_id_here"` - Can be found on the Deploy & Test page of the model on Vertex AI under 'Sample request'

If you are getting a dotenv error, run `npm install react-native-dotenv`.
